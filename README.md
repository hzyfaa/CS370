## Project summary
The project involves an AI powered pirate agent for a treasure hunt game. The aim for the pirate is to navigate a maze and reach the treasure before the player using deep learning. The given starter code incldues TreasureMaze.py, which defines the game environment, and GameExperience.py, which manages learning experiences. A jupyter notebook was provided to simulate gameplay. The primary task was to implement a deep Q-learning algorithm.

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists develop and optimize systems and software to solve complex problems efficiently. With the advancement of technology over time, computer scientists improve automation, user experiences, and decision-making, which directly impacts industries like healthcare and finance. For example, consider intelligent agents that can self-learn from data which can enhance predictive capabilities and automation.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Problem-solving follows a structured approach. Defining a problem and breaking it into more manageable components is the first step. Then, appropriate algorithms and data structures can be applied to enhance and optimize performance. In terms of AI, choosing learning algorithms for decision-making is a first step. Then testing and refining strategies are used to ensure efficiency and validity.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Ethical responsibilities in AI systems include fairness and transparency. Models and systems should avoid misuse of private user data and avoid bias. It is important to follow best practices in security and software development in order to uphold integrity and maintain user trust.
